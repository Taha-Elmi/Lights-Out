# Lights Out Solver
Lights Out is a classic puzzle in which you should turn all lights on. You can toggle a light's state by clicking on it, but all of its adjacent lights will be also toggled. lights_out.py is an implication of the game with pygame, and solver.py will tell you in the terminal how to play to win the game!
